# Vim Settings
My vim settings.

### How to Use
- Run install.sh with your bash
```
. install.sh
```
- Open vim and in the command mode, type:
```
:PlugInstall
```
Notice that at first run you may see some error opening uninstalled packages. It is natural and may be ignored.
- Now, if you want to install YouCompleteMe auto-completer in your vim, follow the guide in [the official page](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#linux-64-bit)
- Happy hacking!
